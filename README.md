# EgymApp

I have used MVVM architecture in this project. I have used it because it is easy to maintain, test, and also easy to reuse components while using the MVVM. Also, I have been using MVVM on my projects over the years.

URLCache is used for caching the images.

For intance I have used only 'home' api only to show the top stories. For NewsList view, we call /home API and if the API fails, we won't show any data as of now.

There is no pagination added since the API has the option only to fetch all the news at a time.

We can refresh the news by swiping down.

Due to the time frame, I haven't spent much time on the UI design since my main focus was on the architecture.
